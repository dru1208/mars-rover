1. process text input
2. set new class instance grid
3. set new class instance rover
4. process movement instructions, add to answer
5. repeat for each set of rovers/instructions
6. return answer


grid class:
x value
y value
necessary to check if the x and y values are valid (> 0, and integers)


rover class:
position x
position y
direction
method for rotating L ()
method for rotating R ()
method for moving forward space (), accesses this.direction and uses switch cases


method for instructions, runs through each instruction (array) and applies the function to it



the first of each chunk of 2 input lines will generate a new class
the second line will call class methods to manipulate the rover


start with rover rotation and movement logic
